Python 3: You'll need Python 3 to run the Flask backend.
Pipenv (recommended): Use Pipenv to manage your Python virtual environment and dependencies for better isolation and reproducibility.
(Optional) PostgreSQL: For production or a more robust database setup, install PostgreSQL.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Tripp-L/phase4-space-proj/tree/main
cd https://github.com/Tripp-L/phase4-space-proj/tree/main
